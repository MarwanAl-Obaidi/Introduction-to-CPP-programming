# Introduction-to-CPP-programming
A refresher course I did that teaches the fundamentals of CPP programming.

## ex_1_1
The purpose of this exercise is to introduce you to writing programs with C++. Below is a C++ program. Your task is to rewrite it. In the next chapter you will learn how the program functions and what it actually does.

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int number;

  cout << "Input an integer:";
  cin >> number;
  cout << "You typed: " << number << endl;
}
```

## ex_2_1
Write a working C++ program that, when started, prints the text: “Hi everybody!” and a line break on screen. After printing the program shuts down.

## ex_2_2
Write a program that asks user for two integers, calculates their sum and prints it on screen. After printing the program shuts down.

## ex_3_1
Write a program that asks user for amount of dollars and converts them to euros. In the end the program prints the amount of euros on screen. The exchange rate for euros is 0.727802. Use variables of the type double.

## ex_3_2
Write a program that asks for the circle radius and calculates the area of the circle based on it. In the end the area is printed on screen. Use the approximate value of 3.142 for π. User is expected to input only integers.

## ex_4_1
Write a program that asks user for two integers and prints the sum, difference, product and remainder of the two numbers.

## ex_4_2
Write a program that calculates the hypotenuse of an orthogonal triangle based on the triangle legs inputted by the user. The leg lengths are assumed to be integers and the hypotenuse value is assigned into a double type variable.
