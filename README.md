# Introduction-to-CPP-programming
A refresher course I did that teaches the fundamentals of CPP programming.

## ex_1_1
The purpose of this exercise is to introduce you to writing programs with C++. Below is a C++ program. Your task is to rewrite it. In the next chapter you will learn how the program functions and what it actually does.

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int number;

  cout << "Input an integer:";
  cin >> number;
  cout << "You typed: " << number << endl;
}
```

## ex_2_1
Write a working C++ program that, when started, prints the text: “Hi everybody!” and a line break on screen. After printing the program shuts down.

## ex_2_2
Write a program that asks user for two integers, calculates their sum and prints it on screen. After printing the program shuts down.
